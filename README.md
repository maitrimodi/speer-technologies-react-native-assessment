# Speer Technologies - React Native Assessment [Maitri Modi]

This is an assessment given by [Speer Technologies](https://speer.io/) developed by Maitri Modi.

Given Requirements

- The goal of this assessment is to build a basic React Native application which demonstrates common tasks such as fetching data, parsing model entities from JSON, UI, and navigation.

Assessment checklist

1. A search bar that enables us to fetch GitHub user profiles by username:

   - If no user exists with the username provided, present a "Not found" view
   - If the user exists, present a view with that user's:
     - Avatar
     - Username
     - Name
     - Description
     - Follower count, i.e. _X followers_
     - Following count, i.e. _X following_

2. A view which displays a list of the user's followers, as well as a view for who they're following
   - We should be able to navigate to this view by tapping on the follower/following counts
   - If a user in this list is tapped, it should navigate us to their profile view
3. The ability to navigate backwards through the navigation stack.
